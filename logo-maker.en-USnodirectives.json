        {
          "question": "What is the BrandCrowd logo maker?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;BrandCrowd's logo maker allows you to generate and customize stand-out logos in minutes. BrandCrowd gives you access to a professional library of thousands of customizable logo designs - making creating your logo inexpensive and straightforward.

          "question": "Do I get a transparent version of my logo?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! A transparent version of your logo is provided when you download in a PNG format. Even if you've chosen a solid background for your logo, we'll provided a version of your logo with a transparent background for your convenience - perfect for use on your website.&lt;/p&gt;"
        },
        {
          "question": "What layout works best for logos?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;You want your logo to standout above competitors. Your logo should tell your audience, customers, fans and competitors that you mean business. There's no single answer for what layout your logo should have - but keep in mind what message your want to convey with your logo. A simple layout can convey elegance and sophistication, while a more dynamic layout can mean fun or adventure. Search our logo collection for a design then customize it according to your needs. Remember you can also research logos - pay attention to their layout, color choices, design themes and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;"
        },
        {
          "question": "What text should I choose for my logo?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;What's in a name? If you haven't already got a name for your logo then here's some tips. You want to use text and a name that describes your business, the caliber of service you provide and one that resonates with customers. If you're stumped, research other companies with logos for inspiration. Remember your logo should have a catchy and non-offensive name that's sits well with the whole team. Try to keep the logo text short and simple using a bold clean font, so it's easily recognisable on your logo.&lt;/p&gt;"
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I find the right logo?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;Simply put, logos are visual representations of what your business is all about. The logo you choose will become synonymous with your brand, so it pays to choose wisely. BrandCrowd offers access to a library packed with logos created by professional designers from around the world. Find the perfect logos is as simple as searching the library, customizing the logo to your liking and downloading. Remember, keeping your logo simple with three or fewer colors and clean fonts produces an effective, eye-catching logo.&lt;/p&gt;"
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I add a tagline to my logo?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;It's easy to enhance your logo with a tagline. A tagline is usually added at the bottom of your logo and consists of a short piece of text like a motto or catchphrase. Taglines that work include three to seven memorable words. Like an advertising jingle or popular song, this additional text on your logo helps further associate your design with your brand. You can add a tagline in a few clicks with BrandCrowd's Logo Maker.&lt;/p&gt;"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I download my logo instantly?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;Yes. Now that you've created the perfect logo, it's time to put your design to work. BrandCrowd allows you to download your logo instantly and gives you access to all the files you need. BrandCrowd provides files perfect for producing marketing and print materials, for using on your website or blog and for branding those social media posts.

        },
        {
          "question": "Do I get my logo in vector format?",
          "answer": "&lt;p&gt;Of course. Your logo from BrandCrowd is provided in several formats including vector files (PDF and SVG). No matter how large you want your logo, it'll look great. Vector files are used to create print layouts and illustrations as they ensure the same quality appearance across all formats and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;"
